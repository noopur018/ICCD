# ICCD

The Indian Cities Change Detection (ICCD) Dataset focuses on building change detection across ten Indian cities: Agra, Ambala, Amritsar, Jammu, Kannur, Kanpur, Kargil, Pune, Roorkee, and Sagar. Each city has its own folder containing two subfolders: labeled and unlabeled data. The labeled data includes approximately 85 annotated images per city, each with a resolution of 1024Ã—1024 pixels. The unlabeled data contains around 140 images of the same resolution. All images were captured using Google Earth Pro between 2022 and 2024. The dataset captures various types of structural changes, including new constructions, demolitions, and renovations, which are highlighted in the annotations.
